## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: PreferenceChain renders an ordered stat-priority chain

The shared `PreferenceChain` component SHALL render an ordered list of `.pref-item` rows
inside a `.pref-chain`, supporting two modes selected by prop:

**Stat-chain mode** (default, unchanged — HSR relic / N2E cartridge editors): each row is
a stat `<select>` plus, for non-tail items, an operator `<select>` (`>`, `>=`, `OR`), and
for the tail item a `.remove-pref-btn` — followed by an `.add-pref-btn`. Appending SHALL
set the previous tail's operator to `>`; removing the tail SHALL clear the new tail's
operator to `null`. Values are `StatPreference[]`; `options` is a `readonly string[]`
where the option value equals its label.

**Ranked-list mode** (new — AE weapon preferences): rows stack full-width in a
`.pref-chain-ranked` container; each `.pref-ranked-item` row is a rank label, a single
`<select>` carrying the shared `.game-select` control styling (so it matches standalone
dropdowns elsewhere) with **no operator select**, a per-item `.remove-pref-btn`, and
up/down reorder controls; followed by an `.add-pref-btn`. There are no comparison
operators between items — the list is a pure ranking ordered by position. `options` is a
`readonly { value, label }[]` so the persisted value (e.g. a weapon `id`) differs from the
shown label; values are the bare ordered value strings. Appending adds the first
not-yet-selected option; reordering swaps adjacent items; removing drops the targeted item
with no operator fixup.

Common props: `onChange`, `namePrefix`. Mode-specific props (`values` shape, `options`
shape, and the mode/variant selector) are defined by the component's TypeScript surface.

#### Scenario: Appending a priority

- **WHEN** "+ Add Priority" is clicked on a non-empty stat-chain
- **THEN** the previous tail's operator becomes `>` and a new tail item is appended with operator
  `null`

#### Scenario: Removing the tail

- **WHEN** the tail item's remove button is clicked in stat-chain mode
- **THEN** the item is dropped and the new tail's operator is reset to `null`

#### Scenario: Appending in ranked-list mode

- **WHEN** the add control is clicked in ranked-list mode
- **THEN** a new row is appended with the first option not already present, and no operator select is rendered on any row

#### Scenario: Removing any item in ranked-list mode

- **WHEN** any row's remove button is clicked in ranked-list mode
- **THEN** that item is dropped, the remaining items keep their relative order, and no operator fixup occurs

#### Scenario: Reordering in ranked-list mode

- **WHEN** a row's up or down control is clicked in ranked-list mode
- **THEN** the item swaps position with its neighbor and `onChange` emits the reordered value list

#### Scenario: Distinct value and label in ranked-list mode

- **WHEN** ranked-list options are provided as `{ value, label }[]`
- **THEN** each row's `<select>` displays the label while `onChange` emits the corresponding value
